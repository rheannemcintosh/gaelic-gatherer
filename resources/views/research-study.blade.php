<h1>Thank you for your interest in participating in our Study!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Gaelic Gatherer Study! We are thrilled to invite you to participate in this research endeavor aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of gamified badges on knowledge retention among users.</p>
<h2>Aim of the Study</h2>
<p>Our primary goal is to assess how gamified badges influence the retention of knowledge acquired through the Gaelic Gatherer platform. By participating in this study, you will contribute valuable insights to our understanding of how gamification can enhance language learning outcomes.</p>
<h2>About Gaelic Gatherer</h2>
<p>The Gaelic Gatherer application is a platform designed to introduce users to the basics of Scottish Gaelic in an engaging and interactive manner. Through a series of lessons and activities, participants will have the opportunity to explore the rich linguistic heritage of Scotland.</p>
<h2>What Does the Study Involve?</h2>
<p>Upon signing up, participants will be invited to utilize the Gaelic Gatherer platform, where they can engage with various learning materials at their own pace. The study requires participants to read information on five key topics related to Scottish Gaelic, which should take approximately five minutes.</p>
<p>Following the exploration of the platform, participants will be asked to provide some personal information, including age, gender identity, nationality, residence, and connections to Scotland and Gaelic.</p>
<p>Subsequently, participants will be prompted to take a short test on Scottish Gaelic, consisting of ten questions, which should take around ten minutes to complete. Additionally, after one hour, participants will receive an email encouraging them to optionally complete another brief test on Gaelic. This test will be repeated after two weeks to gauge long-term retention.</p>
<h2>Personal Data</h2>
<p>Along with data stored in relation to the use of the application, the following personal data is collected to be used in the study:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Age</li>
