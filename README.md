## Work
This platform was developed in support of Rheanne McIntosh's dissertation for the degree of MSc in Computer Science in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Bath.

### Description
This repository hosts a custom-built e-learning platform, to support the research study element of the dissertation. It's aim is to provide a short course on Scottish Gaelic, to investigate the effects of independent gamification variables, on knowledge retention, in support for the preservation of endangered languages. As well as serving the short course to participants, it is also responsible for conducting the remainder of the study, including the study information, signing up for the study, questionnaires and knowledge assessments.
